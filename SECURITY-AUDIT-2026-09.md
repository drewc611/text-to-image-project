## Summary for this repository

| Severity | Count |
|---|---|
| Medium | 1 |
| Low | 1 |

Automated passes run against this repository: gitleaks 8.24.2 (full history and tree), the placeholder-credential checker now shipped in `scripts/`, semgrep 1.178.0 (`p/security-audit`, `p/secrets`, `p/owasp-top-ten`, `p/github-actions`), bandit, pip-audit and npm audit where applicable, plus a manual review of auth, input handling, workflows and deployment files.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Category | Location | Evidence | Impact | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TI-1 | Medium | Every request runs a paid SDXL generation | `src/index.ts:2-10` | `fetch(request, env)` ignores path and method; `env.AI.run("@cf/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", ...)` | Favicon requests, crawlers and a curl loop all bill neurons; no cache, auth or limit. | Restrict to `GET /`, cache the result, add a rate limit or Turnstile, set a spend alert. | open |
| TI-2 | Low | Vulnerable dev dependencies | `package-lock.json` | npm audit (incl. dev): 6 High (0 in prod) | Build-time only. | `npm audit fix`. | open |

## Guardrails added in this change

- `scripts/check-placeholder-secrets.sh` — fails the build on placeholder credentials, secret defaults, disabled-auth defaults, `debug=True`, literal secret assignments, private keys and committed `.env` files.
- `.gitleaks.toml` — gitleaks defaults plus custom placeholder rules and a fixture allowlist.
- `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml` — runs both on every push and pull request and weekly over full history (SHA-pinned actions).
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — the same checks locally; run `pre-commit install` once.
- `docs/security/AI-CODING-GUARDRAILS.md` — the binding rules for any AI-assisted change, with references.
- A "Security rules for AI-assisted changes" section in `CLAUDE.md` (and `AGENTS.md` / Copilot instructions where present).
- `.gitignore` rules for `.env`, keys and Terraform state where they were missing.

See the cross-repository report for the fail-closed pattern by language and the prioritised fix list.
